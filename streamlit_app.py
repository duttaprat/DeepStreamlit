This interactive data portal is a companion to our under review *Nature Methods* publication on **DeepVRegulome**. It allows researchers to explore the data, models, and key findings from our study. 
Our framework uses a state-of-the-art DNABERT model to predict how non-coding mutations affect gene regulation, providing critical insights for cancer research.

    st.info("""
    Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed numerous non-coding short variants whose functional impacts remain 
    poorly understood. Despite recent advances in deep-learning genomic approaches, accurately predicting and 
    prioritizing clinically relevant mutations in gene regulatory regions remains a major challenge. Here we 
    introduce DeepVRegulome, a deep-learning method for prediction and interpretation of functionally disruptive 
    variants in the human regulome, which combines 700 DNABERT fine-tuned models, trained on vast amounts of ENCODE 
    gene regulatory regions, with variant scoring, motif analysis, attention-based visualization, and survival 
    analysis. We showcase its application on TCGA glioblastoma WGS dataset in prioritizing survival-associated 
    mutations and regulatory regions. The analysis identified 572 splice-disrupting and 9,837 transcription-factor 
    binding site altering mutations occurring in greater than 10% of glioblastoma samples. Survival analysis 
    linked 1352 mutations and 563 disrupted regulatory regions to patient outcomes, enabling stratification via 
    non-coding mutation signatures. All the code, fine-tuned models, and an interactive data portal are publicly 
    available.
